[[unlikely]] was presented in C++20.
This attribute shows that the current branch of the code is less likely to be executed.
That helps the compiler to optimise code for better performance.
Compiler redistribute resources (like CPU cache) for likely branches.
Unlikely branches may be placed in separate sections to free instructions cache.

Excessive usage of either of these attributes [likely/unlikely] is liable to result in performance degradation.
