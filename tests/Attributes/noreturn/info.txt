[[noreturn]] attribute was presented in C++11 standard. It can be applied only to functions.
It is used to show that the control flow will not be returned to the caller.
Therefore, the function that has this attribute must terminate the program, throw an error or have infinite loop.
When the compiler sees the function with this attribute that returns the control flow, it will show warning.
When such function returns control flow, the behavior of the program is runtime-undefined.
Compiler tries to optimise the code based on this attribute:
1) It not generates the code after the call of the function.
2) Tries to predict which parts of the program are not going to be executed.
3) When the function is called, compiler does not contain the state of a stack.
